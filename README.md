# DISCLAIMER
None of this has to do with the RealitySoft or Bonmario brands, this is a public archive of the source code of a game called b3313. If you fully acknowledge this, please continue browsing the files.

# A simple message to Spongetoo and Benedani
nobody takes you seriously, we're all laughing about the whole situation lmfao, b3313 isnt copyrighted either, and if even if it was it would infringe on nintendo's copyrights and patents for the Super Mario brand
Get gud lmfao

# beeie real
Directory structure:
- `Bangers` - music
- `Bee` - beta shosankee brool greenio rom descargar para android z64 real
- `Levels` - for chrisbrutalagresion to upload the skp files so they don't disappear when his hdd breaks for the 3313th time, unfortunately, he never did so
- `MiscTweaks` - tweaks that probably should be covered in trollengine as armips is fully capable of more readable tweaks
- `TrollEngine` - decomp in binary?? no way?? - the main programming directory that covers all things programming or tweaking
- `old shit` - a bunch of things from pre troll engine era

# How to build Troll Engine
If you are a programmer and are wondering to yourself: "bro what the fuck, how do I do decomp in binary, it must be so complicated!"

... you would be correct! It is a near impossible task, only achievable by those with the sufficient knowledge to comprehend some new knowledge and follow a basic guide. (Humans, probably.)

## What black magic is going on here?!
It is not exactly black magic, really. You must simply understand the basics of how C compilation works.

When you build a .c file, it does not immediately become an executable - it goes through an intermediary stage, the object file (.o). It is with the help of a *linker* that the .o files are then turned into an executable.

In our case, **Armips** is the linker; it handles references to each other's symbols (functions, variables) within the .o files. It does this while allowing us to **import the data inside the .o file anywhere in the ROM.**

Due to the consistency in how functions are generated by the compiler, as long as the parameters and return type are the same, **it is possible to replace any function in the game with any other without causing any trouble!**

## Setup 
1. Set up a Linux environment in which you can build [SM64 decomp](https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64/). The rest of this guide will assume you are using a terminal within this Linux environment.
2. In `TrollEngine/tools`, run `make` to build `cc` and `n64graphics`.

## Compiling .c files to .o files
To turn your .c file into a .o file which can then be imported with armips:
1. In `TrollEngine`, run `sh build_all.sh` (or one of the subcommands that each cover a specific group of directories).
2. If you would like to add a new directory for building .c files in, feel free to edit one of the .sh files (or create a new one!).

## Building
In `TrollEngine`, simply run `sh click here to meet a cold armips in your area.sh`. This will update `Bee/b3313 silved.z64`.

## Make release ROMs unreadable
In order to prevent early release infants from extracting data from our ROM, we have done a small amount of trolling.

In `TrollEngine`, run `sh shiftma.sh`. A new ROM file will appear in the Bee directory, called `b3313 shifted.z64`.
